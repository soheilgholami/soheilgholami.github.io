<p style="text-align:left; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory
(<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/">LASA</a>) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
(EPFL, Switzerland) since March 2022.
I completed my Ph.D. in Bioengineering with a dual affiliation.
I was a member of both the Human-Robot Interfaces and Interaction (<a href="https://hri.iit.it/">HRII</a>)
group at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genoa, Italy), and the Neuroengineering and Medical Robotics Laboratory
(<a href="https://nearlab.polimi.it/">Nearlab</a>) at the Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMi, Italy).
My doctoral dissertation, completed in February 2022, focused on developing a methodology to investigate the usability and ergonomics of telerobotic systems.
I earned my Master's degree in Control Engineering from K. N. Toosi University of Technology (Tehran, Iran) at the Advanced Robotics and Automated System Laboratory (<a href="https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/">ARAS</a>), focusing on implementing a robust nonlinear control method for bilateral teleoperated eye surgery.

<p style="text-align:left; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
My research studies involve robotics, human motor control, and the intersection between these two disciplines, exploring both fields individually as well as how they (might) influence each other. 
More specifically, my research concentrates on various aspects of human-robot interaction and collaboration (both remote and proximate), task and motion/force planning, human factors and ergonomics, and skill acquisition and assessment.
