<p style="text-align:left; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory
(<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/">LASA</a>) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
(<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>, Switzerland), a role I've been dedicated to since March 2022.
I completed my Ph.D. in Bioengineering with a dual affiliation.
I was a member of both the Human-Robot Interfaces and Interaction (<a href="https://hri.iit.it/">HRII</a>)
group at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genoa, Italy), and the Neuroengineering and Medical Robotics Laboratory
(<a href="https://nearlab.polimi.it/">Nearlab</a>) at the Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMi, Italy).
My doctoral dissertation, completed in February 2022, focused on developing a methodology to investigate the usability and ergonomics of telerobotic systems.
I earned my Master's degree in Control Engineering from K. N. Toosi University of Technology (Tehran, Iran) at the Advanced Robotics and Automated System Laboratory (<a href="https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/">ARAS</a>), focusing on implementing a robust nonlinear control scheme for bilateral teleoperated eye surgery.
My research interests include human-robot interaction and collaboration, skill acquisition and assessment, and human motor control.
