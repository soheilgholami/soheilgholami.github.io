I am attending the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neural Control of Movement (<a href="https://ncm-society.org/2024-meeting/">NCM 2024</a>), which is taking place from April 15 to 19, 2024, in the historic and spectacular city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. I will be presenting my poster entitled "Motor Skills Assessment of Microsurgical Anastomosis."
