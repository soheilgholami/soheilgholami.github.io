title:  "SOPHIA: Socio-physical Interaction Skills for Cooperative Human-Robot Systems in Agile Production"
---

The H2020-ICT10 project [SOPHIA](https://project-sophia.eu/project/overview) – Socio-physical Interaction Skills for Cooperative Human-Robot Systems in Agile Production – aims to create a new generation of core robotic technologies for socially cooperative human-robot systems. The objectives are to achieve a reconfigurable and resource-efficient production and improve human comfort and trust in automation, in hybrid human-plus-robot manufacturing environments (G.A: 871237).

In addition to my work on the Ergo-Lean project, I made the following contributions to SOPHIA project in the final year of my Ph.D.:
