title:  "Quantitative Assessment of Skills and Acquisition in Microsurgery"
---

This [project](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/microsurgery/) combines magnification with advanced microscopes and specialized precision tools to develop an objective evaluation tool for the assessment of microsurgical competence.

Teaching and assessment of skill acquisition in microsurgery is tricky as there are not clear and objective standards. It relies on subjective opinions of senior faculty. However, optimizing the training of future microsurgeons is of great importance and includes objective assessment of skills,  learning curves, and value of various training models.
The goals of the proposed project is to add scientific knowledge on how hand position, force application and movements change during the surgeonâ€™s trainings and to advance clinical teaching by developing an objective evaluation tool for the assessment of microsurgical competence (the project is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Project number 325230_204694).
