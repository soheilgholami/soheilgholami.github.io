title:  "Haptic-enabled Teleoperated System for Eye Surgery"
---

During my Master's program, I had the opportunity to work with the Surgical Robotics team at ARAS lab, K. N. Toosi University of Technology, for two years. My thesis, titled "*Implementing a Robust Nonlinear Control Scheme in Teleoperation with Time-Varying Delay for Eye Surgery*," allowed me to contribute to this innovative project at its early stage. Since my involvement, the project has seen considerable development and evolution. For more details, please, click on the [link](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/research-themes/surgicalrobotics/).

I made the following contributions to this project:
