title:  "Four-Handed Human Robot Manipulation for Laparoscopic Surgery"
---

This [project](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/4hands/) tackles the design of a 4-arms system with application to laparoscopic surgery. Currently, this task is performed by at least two people: the surgeon and one assistant who is manipulating the endoscope and the retractor. The envisioned 4-arms system would enable the surgeon to control all four instruments. This may increase synchrony in the movements and avoid ambiguity arising from miscommunication.

As the postdoctoral researcher at LASA-EPFL, I made the following contributions to this project:
