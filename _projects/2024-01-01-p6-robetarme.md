This [project](https://www.robetarme-project.eu/) aims toward a step-change in the Construction 4.0 by automating particularly laborious construction tasks in all phases of shotcrete application (Grant Agreement No. 101058731).

To this end RoBétArmé will deliver collaborative construction mobile manipulators, consisting of an:
(i) *Inspection Reconnaissance manipulator (IRR)* to address fast, high precision modelling and rebar reinforcement through metal additive manufacturing in the preparatory phase, and;
(ii) a *Shotcrete and Finishing mobile manipulator (SFR)* to address autonomous shotcrete application and surface finishing during the construction and finishing phase, respectively.
